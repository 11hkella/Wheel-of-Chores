## WHEEL OF CHORES - PROJECT TWO
Wheel of Chores is a scheduling app that helps groups of people accomplish recurring tasks such as home cleaning or monthly errands. Create a new wheel to begin, then add members and assign them chores to complete. When a task is finished, a member may mark it as "done" and the chore then gets assigned to the next member. In this manner, chores will rotate from member to member, creating a fair and accountable way to manage group responsibilities.
